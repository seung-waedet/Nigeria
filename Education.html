        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Education in Nigeria is overseen by the Ministry of Education. Local authorities take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled public education and state schools at a regional level.</p> The education system is divided into Kindergarten, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of Nigeria.<p> 68% of the Nigerian population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).</p>
